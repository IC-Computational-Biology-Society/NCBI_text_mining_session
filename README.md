# Text mining NCBI Pubmed using Entrez 

In this session, we will cover some basic features from the Entrez module embedded within the BioPython package. The session will introduce you to scripting automated searches of the NCBI Pubmed database as well as some approaches to exploring rudimentary ways of analysing text data. Anyone who has attended both of our previous Python workshops will have all the necessary background to complete this session. If you have not been able to make our previous Python sessions, all the Jupyter notebooks from them are posted on repositories within the IC-Computational-Biology-Society organisation. 

**NB:** This session does not cover natural language processing or topics in machine learning. Nevertheless, it should give you the foundation to begin an investigation that culminates in the use of dedicated Python packages, such as NLTK. By the end of the session, you should be able to construct your own dataset of NCBI Pubmed text data on which to (potentially) start training machine learning models.

If you are attending our virtual interactive session on Microsoft Teams, please make sure you can run Anaconda, which can be easily obtained from Imperial College's [AppsAnywhere platform](https://softwarehub.imperial.ac.uk/) or from the [offical Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) (only recommended if you cannot access AppsAnywhere or completing the tutorial outside of the scheduled session).
